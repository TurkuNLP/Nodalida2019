## CALL FOR WORKSHOP PROPOSALS

The Northern European Association for Language Technology (NEALT) invites proposals for workshop at its bi-annual conference on human language and speech technologies.  NoDaLiDa 2019 will be held between September 30 and October 2, 2019 on the campus of the University of Turku in Finland. Please mark your calendars.

NoDaLiDa addresses all aspects of speech recognition and synthesis, natural language processing, and computational linguistics—including work in closely related neighbouring disciplines (such as, for example, linguistics or psychology) that is sufficiently formalized or applied to bear relevance to speech and language technologies.

We invite proposals for workshops, to be held on Monday, September 30, immediately preceding the main conference.  Workshops can be either scheduled for a full day (morning and afternoon) or for half a day. Workshop proposals can be submitted in free-text form, anytime before Monday, February 25, by email to ‘nodalida-2019-workshops@googlegroups.com’.

Workshop proposals must include adequate information on at least the following aspects:

* proposed workshop title
* topic and goals of the workshop
* target group and estimated attendance
* workshop organizer(s) and contact(s)
* mode of organization and programme design

## SCHEDULE

* Monday, February 25: Submission of workshop proposals
* Monday, March 18: Notification of workshop selection
* August: Recommended workshop paper submission deadline
* Monday, September 30: Pre-conference Workshops

Organizers of accepted proposals will be responsible for publicizing and running the workshop, including sending out calls for papers, reviewing submissions, producing the camera ready workshop proceedings, and organizing the meeting days.

## SELECTION

The assessment and selection of workshop proposals will be made by the NoDaLiDa 2019 Workshop Chairs.
